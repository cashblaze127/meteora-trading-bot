2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Create the `.env` file with the required data (see below)
4. Start the bot using `npm start`

#### Getting Configuration

### Step 1: Create the .env file

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project directory. Add the following data to the file:
